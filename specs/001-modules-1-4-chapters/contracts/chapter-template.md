## Introduction

[2-3 paragraphs introducing the topic. Use active voice and concrete examples. Explain WHY this topic matters for Physical AI and robotics. Connect to real-world applications.]

### Key Questions This Chapter Answers

- [Question 1]
- [Question 2]
- [Question 3]

---

## Section 1: [Core Concept A - Clear, Descriptive Title]

[Detailed explanation of the concept. Break down complex ideas into digestible chunks. Use numbered steps or bullet points when appropriate. Define technical terms immediately upon introduction.]

### Mermaid Diagram: [Diagram Title]

```mermaid
[Mermaid syntax - flowchart, sequence, class, or state diagram]
[Keep diagrams simple: max 10-12 nodes]
[Use descriptive labels on all connections]
```

**Diagram Explanation**: [Plain-text description of what the diagram shows. This aids accessibility and reinforces understanding.]

### Code Example: [Example Description]

```python
# [Inline comment explaining setup or imports]
import required_library

# [Comment explaining key logic]
def example_function():
    """[Docstring explaining function purpose]"""
    # [Comment explaining important step]
    result = some_operation()
    return result

# [Comment explaining execution]
if __name__ == "__main__":
    example_function()
```

**What this code does**: [1-2 sentence explanation of the code's purpose and how it demonstrates the concept]

**Dependencies**: `pip install [package1] [package2]`
